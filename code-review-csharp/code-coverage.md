# Code Coverage Attributes

- **[EPC28]** Do not apply `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]` to partial classes — it may not cover all parts of the class and gives a false sense of coverage.
- **[EPC29]** Always provide a justification message when using `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage(Justification = "...")]` to document why code is excluded from coverage.
